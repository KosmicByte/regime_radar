"""Single source of truth for the detection-logic version and the running code version.

`MODEL_VERSION` is a semantic version for the *detection logic* — bump it whenever a change
could alter the label produced for an identical input. It is stamped onto every
``RegimeResult`` so a past call can be reproduced exactly and so champion/challenger
comparisons are unambiguous. It is deliberately separate from the package version in
``pyproject.toml`` / ``__init__`` (which tracks the distribution, not the decision logic).
